# Mathematics Solver
Solve Mathematics problems (Most addition and subtraction). Directly from your Terminal!
<br>
This application was developed by me, for those people who love command-line and want to do Calculations in it. Because doing it directly is bit complicated, Its easier with my apps, The Math Solver!

# Features
This application currently supports these math problems:

1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division

But has some limitations, like it can add, subtract, multiply or even divide only upto 9 numbers, but of ANY digits!

##
We are currently working on these features:

1. Perimeter
2. Area
3. Volume
4. Total Surface Area (T.S.A)

##
These are the features planned to be released in future (after current working is done.)

1. Highest Common Factor (H.C.F.)
2. Lowest Common Multipe (L.C.M.)
3. Square, Square root, Cube and Cube roots.

##
If you have any ideas of other features, or already created one, Why don't you send a pull request?<br> I would appreciate it!

# Installation
